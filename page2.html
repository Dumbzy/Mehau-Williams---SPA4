						<p>Linking back to the project I wanted to create a simple and informative website which conveyed the purpose of my concepted VR space. Ideally, I wanted my project to be a VR experience however a First-Person controller will be sufficient to get the message across. REVERA is what I have named my project which is Latin for ‘In Reality’, and in all honesty I just liked the name and its relevance to VR.</p>

						<p>Taking inspiration from Runescapes ‘Grand Exchange’ and the popular art site ‘ArtStation’ I wanted to use these precedents to create a 3D space which serves the purpose of displaying ones work in a gallery fashion. The Grand Exchange was a space in Runescape where players would come to barter their items which was available to the entire server – and ArtStation is a site where users can post their 2D/3D work which has become a very popular and well used platform. Galleries have always been an ideal space to share art within a public forum and as a designer; portfolio pieces are essential to communicate one’s strengths and interests. The precedents which I have used are in essence, a gallery or space to share goods and ideas to vast amounts of people and that was the overall purpose for REVERA.</p>

					<p>When I was first introduced to Yami-ichi I was turned off by the idea of it and connotated it as merely “gypsy nonsense”. It wasn’t until I started perceiving Yami-ichi humorously which I feel was one of the original intentions, that I began to appreciate it. Those who partake in Yami-ichi inspired events give off a very satirical vibe and for some reason or another, reminded me of the YouTube channel ‘Tier Zoo’ who is a content creator who gamifies the animal kingdom. In both cases, their mere existence and use of information isn’t necessarily vital for the everyday, but it is a welcome change to what can be considered mundane or obsolete. In other words, I like how they have made a big deal out of something normal. One of my early ideas which I want to implement, is to create elaborate stories on the objects displayed within the VR world however mundane they may be.</p>
